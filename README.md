- **Vision:** Users and companies access compute as effortlessly as they use electricity — no manual provisioning, no monitoring, no juggling multiple clouds or clusters.
- **Core Mechanism:**
    1. **Aggregation Layer:** Pull in all available compute (cloud, on-prem, decentralised) and normalise it.
    2. **Intelligent Orchestration:** Agentically allocate, scale, and optimise workloads based on cost, latency, availability, and priority.
    3. **Financialisation:** Treat compute as a liquid asset; enable dynamic pricing, trading, and hedging so that compute can be “bought, sold, or reserved” like a commodity.

**Key Differentiators:**

- Full automation of compute provisioning and scaling (“hands-free”).
- Market-driven efficiency: cost and allocation dynamically optimised.
- Converts compute from an opaque operational cost into a **financially fungible asset**.
